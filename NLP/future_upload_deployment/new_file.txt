As more than three thousand docket entry filings, two jury trials, and several appeals have already taken place in this case, a brief recitation of the relevant facts is helpful to understand the procedural context in which the parties' motions are made. Apple and Samsung sell competing smartphones and tablets. On April 15, 2011, Apple filed suit against Samsung, asserting numerous intellectual property and antitrust claims. See ECF No. 1. In July and August 2012, after pretrial case narrowing, Apple tried to a jury claims as to three utility patents, four design patents, one registered trade dress, and three unregistered trade dresses against 28 accused Samsung products. See ECF No. 1931. The jury found that 26 of the 28 accused products infringed or diluted one or more of Apple's asserted intellectual property rights and awarded Apple $1,049,343,540 in damages. Id. at 15. Following a multitude of post-trial orders, the Court held a partial damages retrial in November 2013. See ECF No. 2822. The total damages award against Samsung ultimately amounted to $929,780,039. ECF No. 3017.
    Samsung filed a Notice of Appeal to the Federal Circuit in March 2014. ECF No. 3018. On May 18, 2015, the Federal Circuit affirmed-in-part, reversed-in-part, vacated-in-part, and remanded this Court's judgment. ECF No. 3271. The Federal Circuit affirmed the validity and infringement judgments with respect to Apple's design and utility patents, and "the damages awarded for the design and utility patent infringements appealed by Samsung." Id., at 4. However, the Federal Circuit reversed "the jury's findings that the asserted trade dresses are protectable" and vacated the damages awards against the Samsung products that were found liable for trade dress dilution. Id. The Federal Circuit remanded "for immediate entry of final judgment on all damages awards not predicated on Apple's trade dress claims and for any further proceedings necessitated by our decision to vacate the jury's verdicts on the unregistered and registered trade dress claims." Id., at 33.
    The Federal Circuit's vacatur of the jury's verdicts on trade tress claims required retrial of damages for five Samsung products on remand. Upon receipt of the Federal Circuit's mandate on September 1, 2015, ECF No. 3273, the Court issued a Case Management Order setting retrial for Spring 2016. ECF No. 3272, at 3 ("September 1, 2015 Order"). As it did in connection with the retrial of damages in November 2013, see ECF No. 2316, at 2-3, the Court again ordered that the parties would not be permitted to expand the scope of the damages remand trial:
    Pursuant to the Federal Circuit's mandate, on September 18, 2015, this Court also entered partial final judgment against Samsung and in favor of Apple in the amount of $548,176,477 according to the affirmed damages awards for 18 Samsung products. ECF No. 3290. Samsung appealed the Court's entry of partial final judgment to the Federal Circuit on September 21, 2015. ECF No. 3292. The Federal Circuit summarily affirmed this Court's entry of partial final judgment. ECF No. 3319. This Court again received the mandate from the Federal Circuit on December 1, 2015. ECF No. 3321. That partial final judgment has been paid and is not at issue here. ECF No. 3332.
    The instant retrial on damages will be the parties' fourth jury trial before this Court, third jury trial in the instant case, and second damages retrial in the instant case. The sole purpose of the instant damages retrial is to determine the amount of damages for the infringement of Apple's '163, '381, '915, D'305, D'677 and/or D'087 Patents by five Samsung products: the Fascinate, Galaxy S4G, Galaxy S Showcase, Mesmerize, and Vibrant.
    The Court will not allow substitution of damages experts absent extraordinary circumstances such as Mr. Musika's death after the 2012 jury trial. The Court will not allow supplemental fact discovery. The Court will not permit the parties to expand the scope of the damages retrial and will not allow the parties to rely on new sales data, new products, new methodologies or new theories. . . .
    The Court's prior rulings on the parties' Daubert motions, motions in limine, discovery disputes, and evidentiary objections will main in effect as law of the case. The parties may not relitigate these issues.
    Each side is limited to one motion to strike, which may not exceed five pages. Each side's opposition shall not exceed five pages. Each side's reply shall not exceed three pages.
    Id. at 2-3. Following a case management conference on September 18, 2015, the Court set a final pretrial and trial schedule in a further Case Management Order. ECF No. 3289. The parties' instant Motions to Strike followed.
    Apple moves to strike portions of Wagner's November 2015 Report, and Samsung moves to strike portions of Davis's November 2015 Report. In addition to its Motion, Apple filed both an opposition (ECF No. 3345-3, "Apple Opp.") to Samsung's Motion and a Reply (ECF No. 3359-3, "Apple Reply") in support of Apple's Motion.
